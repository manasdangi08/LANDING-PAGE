            Lets take a look at some content ideas that are helpful and which
            your clients will totally resonate with: Yoga poses. Whether you're
            a beginner or a pro, knowing what you can get out of different Yoga
            poses is really valuable. No. 1 leads nicely into no. 2; show your
            expertise by demonstrating how to get your poses right and outlining
            dos and donts. You can use carousel posts and split images to
            demonstrate. Yoga variations. Whats the difference between Hatha and
            Ashtanga and whats right for different people looking to start or
            switch up their sessions? Short flows. Demonstrate flows that people
            can perform regularly at home especially during current lockdowns.
            Are there specific flows you had recommend for stress or before bed?
            Dont be shy! Shout about your success and post client reviews and
            testimonials. There is nothing better than having that social proof
            out there. People trust their friends and peers when they recommend
            businesses so this is really important. And if you can get some
            video reviews, even better - these are the gold standard of
            testimonials.
